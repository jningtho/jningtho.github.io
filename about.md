This is a personal journal capturing my trysts of use cases implementing, deploying and orchestrating infrastructure in the Cloud following DevOps best practices. If someone out there coming across similar situations, scenarios and challenges get a little bit of help and direction to accomplish what they started? Awesome!

Feel free to comment, drop a line, suggest or contribute any changes in the articles. I'd be more than glad to collaborate so someone out there in need can benefit from them.
