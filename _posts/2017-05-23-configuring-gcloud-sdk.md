### CLI Tool to manage Products and Services on Google Cloud

The gCloud SDK is a set of tools required to manages Google Products and Services via command-line and contains the following.
* gcloud - access and manage virtual machines on Compute Engine, right from creating, starting, managing instances and decommisioning via the command line. It is used to manage `authentication`, `configuration`, `interactions with the Cloud Platform APIs` and `connect to the virtual instances via SSH`.

* gsutil - provides CLI access and manage `Google Cloud Storage`, `buckets` and `objects`.

* bq - allows to manage and `run queries`, `manipulate datasets`, `tables` and `entities` in BigQuery.

You can run these tools interactively or in your automated scripts.
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
